## ISSUES
<br>

### My own database movie
<br>
This was my first react project by myself. I had to use a backend created in collaboration with #GeeksHubs Academy partner, but when I started the project I realized I would have to do some modifications cause I use my backend to fill my own database movie. 
<br><br>

### HEROKUAPP:

I try to upload my front-end and back-end to HEROKU SERVICE. I did but for some reasons I didn't know how to fix I couln'd connect my front with my backend. I waste a lot of hours trying to figure out searching on internet but at some time I decide quit that and continue developing the project.

### Stuff I left behind

Due this issues I left behind several stuff I wanted to finish:

- Nice landing page
- Filter movies by rate
- Filter movies by year
- Movies recomendations
- Become Premium User
- Control Premium expiration date
